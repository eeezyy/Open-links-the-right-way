# Open links the right way

**This chrome extention makes it easier to navigate through the internet.**
It transforms the links on the current page so that external links always open in new tabs/windows. You will never lose a page from where you have started from again.

The chrome extension can be installed at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-links-the-right-way/ekbjakhahbafakgnpnmnckmiglmeaobb).

The icon used for this extension was designed by Flaticon.com
